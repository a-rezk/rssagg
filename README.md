# RSS Aggregator API ðŸš€
A backend service built with Go that allows users to subscribe to RSS feeds and aggregate posts from multiple sources into a personalized feed. The service features a background scraper that concurrently fetches new posts on a regular schedule.

## Features
  - User Management: Simple user creation and authentication via auto-generated API keys.

  - Feed Management: Authenticated users can add new RSS feeds to the system.

  - Feed Subscriptions: Users can follow and unfollow feeds to customize their content.

  - Concurrent Scraping: A background worker process constantly fetches the latest posts from all tracked feeds.

  - Personalized Feeds: Users can retrieve a list of the most recent posts from only the feeds they follow.

## Technology Stack ðŸ”§
  - **Go**: The core language for the backend server.

  - **MySQL**: SQL database for storing all data.

  - **go-chi/chi**: For lightweight, powerful HTTP routing and middleware.

  - **sqlc**: For generating type-safe Go code from raw SQL queries.

  - **goose**: For managing database schema migrations.

  - **joho/godotenv**: For loading environment variables from a .env file.

  - **google/uuid**: For generating unique IDs.

## API Endpoints
The service exposes the following RESTful API endpoints. All routes are prefixed with /v1.

### Prerequisites
Go (version 1.22 or newer)

A running SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

[sqlc](https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc) and [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) installed

### Installation

- Clone the repo
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/a-rezk/rssagg
cd rssagg
```

- Install Dependencies
```Bash
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
```

- Configure Environment
```Bash
echo 'PORT="8080" 
DB_URL="root:YourPassword@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/rssagg"' > .env
```

- Run Database Migrations then Generate Database Code
```Bash
# Replace "mysql" with "postgres" if needed
goose mysql "DB_URL" up && sqlc generate
```

- Run the Server
```Bash
go build && ./rssagg
# Alternatively, for development, you can just run:
go run main.go
```

*The server should now be running on the port you specified in your .env file*
