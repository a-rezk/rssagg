RSS Aggregator API ðŸš€
A backend service built with Go that allows users to subscribe to RSS feeds and aggregate posts from multiple sources into a personalized feed. The service features a background scraper that concurrently fetches new posts on a regular schedule.

Features
User Management: Simple user creation and authentication via auto-generated API keys.

Feed Management: Authenticated users can add new RSS feeds to the system.

Feed Subscriptions: Users can follow and unfollow feeds to customize their content.

Concurrent Scraping: A background worker process constantly fetches the latest posts from all tracked feeds.

Personalized Feeds: Users can retrieve a list of the most recent posts from only the feeds they follow.

Technology Stack ðŸ”§
Go: The core language for the backend server.

MySQL: SQL database for storing all data.

go-chi/chi: For lightweight, powerful HTTP routing and middleware.

sqlc: For generating type-safe Go code from raw SQL queries.

goose: For managing database schema migrations.

joho/godotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.

google/uuid: For generating unique IDs.
